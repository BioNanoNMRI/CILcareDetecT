# Change Log
All notable changes to this software application will be documented in this file.
- Software Editor  : BioNanoNMRI
- Application Name : CILcare Detec-T

## [1.1.1] - 2016-04-05
	### Changed
	- The onSaveRoiStatsButtonClicked callback method has been split in 2 - saveRoiStatsToTxt and saveRoiStatsToCsv - in order to
		save ROI stats data in both pure text format (compatible with MS NotePad, Linux Gedit and Apple TextEdit) and CSV format
		(compatible with MS Excel, OpenOffice Calc and Apple Numbers).
	### Added
	- All buttons except "Load DICOM..." button are now grayed out at startup until some DICOM file have been loaded.
	- "Save Figure..." and "Save ROI Stats..." buttons are now grayed out until there are some ROI in memory, to be saved.
	- A "ROI Color..." button now allows to change the ROI set color, before or after it is being drawn or loaded.
	- A "Save Figure..." button now allows to export the final figure with its ROI as a JPG file (a bit buggy under MatLab R2012b
		for Linux, works fine under MatLab R2016a for Mac OS).
	- "Save ROI Stats" button now save data to both TXT and CSV files, CSV has been tested in OpenOffice and Numbers for Mac OS.
	- CRoi class now implements a getArea method which counts the number of pixels in circular ROI object.

## [1.1.0] - 2016-04-04
	### Changed
	- Application now provides a graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons and controls.
	- ROI are now displayed with transparent red circles, more convenient than the previous blue contours.
	- DICOM image is now displayed in a scrollable panel, providing true 100% zoom and an easier navigation.
	- The onDrawRoiButtonClicked callback method has been decomposed to provide a rebuildRoiSet method which captures ROI set from
		the mouse cursor if roiPositions parameter is empty.
	### Added
	- ROI are now displayed using transparency which can be adjusted using a slider. 
	- ROI position (x,y) is now stored in CRoi object, getter method has been added to.
	- ROI positions can now be saved in a .mat file and reloaded at any time.
	- Changing the ROI diameter edit field now updates the currently displayed ROI on the fly.
	- Changing the number of ROI edit field now clear all ROI, so that new ROI set can be drawn or loaded.
	- The last used directory selected by the user via file dialog boxes is now memorized and reused for faster operation.
	- File & dir dialog boxes now check if the user has cancel the current operation.

## [1.0.3] - 2016-03-22
	### Added
	- TE values taken from images 1 and 2 are now printed in Stats text file with the T2 values computed in ROIs.

## [1.0.2] - 2016-03-21
	### Changed
	- computeStats method removed in CRoi class, replaced by individual methods getMin, getMax, etc.
	- computeStats method in CilcareDetecT class divided in 2 methods: computeStats and printStats.
	- computeStats method only do the calculations.
	- printStats methods only write stats data to text file.
	### Added
	- Min, max, and mean values measured in images are now stored as members of the CilcareDetecT class.
	- Min, max, mean, etc. values measured in ROI are now stored as members of the CilcareDetecT class.
	- TE values implemented as members of CilcareDetecT clas, extracted from DICOM info struct.
	- T2 values computed from images 1 and 2 in ROI, then written to stats text file.

## [1.0.1] - 2016-03-17
	### Changed
	- Default number of ROI has been increased from 6 to 9.

## [1.0.0] - 2016-03-17
	### Added
	- First release of the application.
	- Based on Yves Cazals' (Cilcare) MatLab script "AA_ImagePlusieursRdI_EllipsesFixes.m".
